			" The story of his birth is as fascinating as his mighty deeds.<br><br>But to know about Hanuman, " +
			"we have to go back sometime before his birth." +
			" Let us go to the palace of Lord Brahma where it all started.<br><br>Do you know who Lord Brahma is?" +
			" He is the Hindu god of creation. He is believed to live in a beautiful divine palace in his heavenly abode." +
			" Such was the beauty of the palace that it was a constant source of amazement for even the deities." +
			"<br><br>There were a number of attendants in the celestial palace-courts of Lord Brahma. " +
			"Among them was a beautiful attendant named Anjana. Once, happy with her service," +
			"Lord Brahma decided to reward her. He called her and asked what she wanted.<br><br>nAnjana hesitated at first." +
			"Then she replied Lord, I wish you could remove a curse pronounced on me by a sage, Tell me about it. " +
			"Maybe I can help you said Lord Brahma.Hopeful that her curse may be removed, Anjana continued " +
			"When I was playing as a child on earth, once I saw a monkey meditating with its legs folded in a lotus pose, " +
			"like a human sage. It was a funny sight; so I threw some fruits at it.<br><br>" +
			"But here I made a mistake. " +
			"For it was no ordinary monkey. A powerful sage had taken the form of a monkey to do his tapasya (spiritual practice). " +
			"My fruits disturbed his penance and he opened his eyes in great indignation.<br><br>As soon as he saw me," +
			" he cursed me that " +
			"I would become a monkey when I fall in love with anyone." +
			" I begged him to forgive me.<br><br>The sage said that as he had already uttered it, " +
			"he couldn't change the curse. But he assured me that the man" +
			" I fall in love with will love me in spite of my monkey face." +
			"<br><br>Lord Brahma, I was born and brought up here." +
			" How can I live with a monkey face among my beautiful sisters? " +
			"If you kindly grant me a boon to become my usual self, I will be very much obliged,she said anxiously.<br><br>" +
			"Brahma felt sorry for the unfortunate apsara. " +
			"He thought for a moment. Then he lifted his eyes towards the anxious Anjana.<br><br>" +
			"I see a way for removing your curse, " +
			"Anjana,he said kindly. Go to earth and live there for a while." +
			" You will meet your husband on earth and your curse will be removed if you - give birth to an incarnation of Lord Shiva," +
			" said Lord Brahma.<br><br>Anjana accepted Brahma's advice." +
			"She was born in the earth shortly afterwards." +
			" She lived in a forest as a young huntress.<br><br>One day she saw a strong man fighting with a lion. What a brave man!" +
			" she thought in wonder. How I wish he will look at me!<br><br>As Anjana looked at the warrior in admiration, " +
			"the man turned and saw her. As soon as his eyes fell on her, she turned into a monkey!<br><br>With a pathetic cry, " +
			"Anjana sank to the ground and covered her face with her hands. " +
			"Seeing her fall to the ground, the man came running towards her.<br><br>Who are you fair maiden? " +
			"Why do you cry? Uncover your face. Let me see you, he asked her.<br><br>I cannot, brave man, Anjana answered gloomily." +
			"I am Anjana, an apsara cursed to become a monkey when I fall in love." +
			" I request you to please leave me alone in my sorrow,she wailed and peeked at the handsome man through her fingers." +
			"<br><br>To her great astonishment she found a big monkey-faced man standing before her! " +
			"If she didn't see his face at first, it was because she couldn't and because till now she saw him from a distance." +
			"<br><br>The monkey-faced man understood her surprise. He spoke." +
			"I am not human, though I can take the human form if I want. I am Kesari, " +
			"the king of Monkeys, blessed by Lord Shiva with magical powers." +
			" If you become my wife, I will be honoured. Would you honour me by becoming my wife, dear Anjana?<br><br>Anjana" +
			" became very happy. " +
			"She accepted his proposal.Then the sage's word was indeed true, thought Anjana," +
			" Kesari didn't mind my appearance because" +
			" he himself is a monkey!<br><br>Anjana and Kesari were married in the forests." +
			" Being a pious devotee, Anjana performed intense tapasya, worshipping Lord Shiva.<br><br>Lord Shiva was pleased with her." +
			" He appeared before her and asked her what she wanted.<br><br>Lord Shiva, I wish you to be born as my son," +
			" so that I can be freed from the sage's curse, requested Anjana.<br><br>So be it!. " +
			"Lord Shiva gave his consent and disappeared.Soon after this, one day, as Anjana was worshipping Lord Shiva, " +
			"in another part of the country, Dasaratha, the king of Ayodhya," +
			" was performing a yagna (religious rite) to have children. It was the Putrakama Yagna. " +
			"As a result, Agni, the Fire-God gave him some sacred payasa " +
			"(pudding) and asked him to share the payasa among his wives so that they may have divine children." +
			"<br><br>Here, Lord Shiva's boon to Anjana started to work. While Dasaratha gave payasa to his elder wife Kausalya, " +
			"by divine ordinance a kite snatched a portion of that pudding.<br><br>Holding the pudding in its tails," +
			" the kite-bird flew away from Ayodhya towards the forests Anjana lived." +
			" It flew over the dense trees and dropped the payasa where Anjana was engaged in tapasya." +
			"<br><br>Vayu, the ever-present Wind-God, saw this event.Go, Vayu!he heard a silent command in his mind from Lord Shiva. " +
			"Vayu immediately caught that portion of pudding and placed onto the outstretched hands of Anjana.<br><br>Anjana" +
			" felt something " +
			"drop in her hand. She opened her eyes and looked at the payasa in her hand." +
			" Is this offering from Lord Shiva? she wondered and " +
			"swallowed it.<br><br>As the divine pudding went inside her throat, " +
			"Anjana immediately felt the blessings of Lord Shiva." +
			" In due course, she gave birth to a little monkey-faced boy. " +
			"Kesari was very happy to see his son." +
			" The child was called as Anjaneya or the son of Anjana.<br><br>Having given birth to Lord Shiva's incarnation," +
			" Anjana was released from the curse of the sage." +
			" She began to express her wish to return to Heaven." +
			"<br><br>When Anjaneya came to know about her mother's wish, he became sad. Mother, without you what will be my future?" +
			" How can I feed myself? How will I live?he asked.Don't worry, Anjaneya, said Anjana." +
			"Your father is the brave Kesari. Your guardian spirit is the life-giving Vayu." +
			" They'll always protect you. When you feel hungry," +
			" fruits as red and ripe as a rising sun would be your nourishment.<br><br>Saying so, " +
			"Anjana kissed her son and left her alone." +
			" She went back to her heavenly abode.<br><br>Fruits as red and ripe as the sun?thought Anjaneya." +
			"Is sun such a ripe fruit? Let's see!<br><br>" +
			"Thinking that the sun was actually some delicious fruit," +
			" the baby Anjaneya wanted to taste the sun. Now, Anjaneya was a divine child." +
			" His mother was an apsara and his father was a Monkey-King," +
			" so it was natural that little Anjaneya should inherit some magical powers." +
			" He was, after all, an incarnation of Lord Shiva." +
			" So reaching for the sun was not a tough task for him." +
			" He made a giant leap to catch the glowing ball on the sky.<br><br>Suryadeva," +
			" the Sun-God was glowing peacefully in the sky when he suddenly saw a monkey coming towards him." +
			" The monkey grew bigger and bigger as he neared the sun." +
			" But the terribly hot rays which made any mortal presence impossible near the sun," +
			" had no effect on the creature.<br><br>Seeing that," +
			" Suryadeva got scared and started calling out for help.Indra! Indra! Help me!he shouted." +
			"<br><br>Indra, king of the gods in heaven, was resting nearby in his heavenly abode." +
			" He was surprised to hear the Sun-God pleading for his help.<br><br>Why is Suryadeva yelling for my help?" +
			"Indra wondered.Is he not powerful enough to burn everything that comes near him?" +
			" Or is it something beyond his control? I have to see what's happening!<br><br>" +
			"Indradeva promptly climbed on Airavatha the white elephant," +
			" his mount, and left his abode to find the cause of Suryadeva's fear." +
			" Soon he found that a flying monster was trying to catch hold of the sun." +
			"Little wonder then that Suryadeva was so scared!thought Indra," +
			" who had never seen such a creature.<br><br>Nearing the sun, " +
			"Indra was surprised to see that the monster was actually a giant monkey.<br><br>Stop! he ordered." +
			"Who are you? Why are you trying to catch the sun?<br><br>I'm Anjaneya, son of Kesari and Anjana." +
			"replied the giant child. My mother told me that fruits as ripe as the red sun will be my food so" +
			" I'm going to catch the sun " +
			"and eat it.<br><br>At first, Indra was amused by the child's innocence, so he advised him to return to earth." +
			"This is not a fruit, Anjaneya, this is the sun- the source of all light and life." +
			"said he and commanded,Return whence you came." +
			"<br><br>But naughty Anjaneya ignored his commands and continued on his journey to capture the sun." +
			"<br><br>Now Indra became angry at the child's impertinence." +
			" He warned him several times not to go near the sun, but Anjaneya did not listen to him." +
			"<br><br>Finally, " +
			"the King of Devas became so enraged that he struck Anjaneya with his thunderbolt vajra." +
			"<br><br>Kaaabuuuuuuum!!! The thunderbolt hit the child, wounding his chin and causing him to fall down to earth." +
			" The vajra hit Anjaneya's face." +
			" So his cheeks were swollen twice its size." +
			" As the boy fell, his body became smaller and smaller." +
			" Finally he became the child-sized monkey he really was and hit the ground." +
			"<br><br>Vayu, the Wind God, was roaming here and there when he heard a big thud" +
			" Curious, he went towards the direction of the noise to investigate." +
			"<br><br>What he saw shocked Vayu." +
			" He couldn't believe his eyes. Anjaneya was lying unconscious on the ground." +
			" Who had dared to injure his god-son?<br><br>Who has done this?he roared but no one answered." +
			" Indra had already left for his abode and the sun was once again peacefully glowing in the sky." +
			"<br><br>The Wind God was terribly angry." +
			"Why should I bother to do my duty when no one answers my question?he thought." +
			"<br><br>With great affection, he lifted his godson in his hands and went to the Patalloka," +
			" the world below the grounds of the earth.<br><br>As Vayu left the earth, there was no air in the world. " +
			"People, animals and trees struggled to breathe and started to die." +
			"<br><br>The Sun-God was shocked at the turn of the events and he ran to Brahma, telling Him about the calamity on earth." +
			"<br><br>Brahma became worried about the situation on Earth." +
			" He called Indra and accused him." +
			"<br><br>Look what your silly anger has caused!he thundered." +
			"You have hurt a divine child and now the people on earth are suffering because of your mistake. " +
			"This is all because of you!”." +
			"<br><br>Indra hung his head in shame." +
			"I am sorry for my actions he murmured." +
			"<br><br>Brahma took him and the other gods to Patalloka and begged Vayu to return to earth." +
			"<br><br>I beg pardon on behalf of all men, all creatures and divine beings." +
			" Please return to the earth, o gentle Vayu.<br><br>I'll not come anywhere without my Anjaneya, " +
			"Vayu said firmly. Then, using his powers, Brahma magically cured Anjaneya's wounds. " +
			"He also gave him a boon saying, No weapon will be ever able to have an effect on Anjaneya again.”" +
			"<br><br>To please Vayu further, Indra said to the boy, " +
			"You will be a 'Chiranjeevi' (immortal)." +
			"I had taken my aim in your hanu (cheek)." +
			" So from now, you will be called as the valiant Hanuman!”" +
			"<br><br>Thus Anjaneya came to be known as Hanuman and had many more adventures during his childhood." +
			" With the blessings of all the gods,Hanuman became a great warrior later and had helped Lord Rama in his quest to bring back the latter's wife," +
			"Sita. " +
